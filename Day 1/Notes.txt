console.log('Hello', 'World', '!')
console.log('HAPPY', 'NEW', 'YEAR', 2020)
console.log('Welcome', 'to', 30, 'Days', 'Of', 'JavaScript')
As you can see from the snippet code above, console.log() can take multiple arguments.

Congratulations! You wrote your first JavaScript code using console.log().

Comments
We can add comments to our code. Comments are very important to make code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. JavaScript does not execute the comment part of our code. In JavaScript, any text line starting with // in JavaScript is a comment, and anything enclosed like this // is also a comment.

Example: Single Line Comment

// This is the first comment  
// This is the second comment  
// I am a single line comment

Example: Multiline Comment
/*
This is a multiline comment  
 Multiline comments can take multiple lines  
 JavaScript is the language of the web  
 */

 So far, we saw how to display text using the console.log(). If we are printing text or string using console.log(), the text has to be inside the single quotes, double quotes, or a backtick. Example:

console.log('Hello, World!')
console.log("Hello, World!")
console.log(`Hello, World!`)

console.log(2 + 3) // Addition
console.log(3 - 2) // Subtraction
console.log(2 * 3) // Multiplication
console.log(3 / 2) // Division
console.log(3 % 2) // Modulus - finding remainder
console.log(3 ** 2) // Exponentiation 3 ** 2 == 3 * 3

External Script
Similar to the internal script, the external script link can be on the header or body, but it is preferred to put it in the body. First, we should create an external JavaScript file with .js extension. All files ending with .js extension are JavaScript files. Create a file named introduction.js inside your project directory and write the following code and link this .js file at the bottom of the body.

console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
External scripts in the head:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfJavaScript:External script</title>
    <script src="introduction.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
External scripts in the body:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfJavaScript:External script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- JavaScript external link could be in the header or in the body --> 
    <!-- Before the closing tag of the body is the recommended place to put the external JavaScript script -->
    <script src="introduction.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
Open the browser console to see the output of the console.log().


Undefined
In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined.

let firstName
console.log(firstName) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet
